# MPedometer

An application dedicated to enriching the boring norm of the usage of a pedometer application.

An RPG-style pedometer will cause the user to become emotionally invested in the game within the pedometer application, which will motivate the user to take more steps toward their fitness than the idea of their fitness alone.
